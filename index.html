	<h1>Hannah Johnson</h1>
	<p>Hi! I am a 4th year undergrad at Ohio State University studying Math and Computer Science.
		I am intrested in pursuing research related to geometric processing, modeling, geometry and topology, as well as computer vision. 
		This summer I will be participating in an REU at the Fields Institute regarding spectral unmixing of hyperspectral biomedical imaging.
		In the past I interned at JPMC in the controls department and did research with Sergei Chmutov in the Knots and Graphs Program at OSU.
